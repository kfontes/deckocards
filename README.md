# deckocards
This is a webpage which will show you a 52 card deck with four Joker cards added. There is an option of doing a random shuffle of the deck and also to collect the Joker cards into a separate deck. You will need to click on the 'Collect Jokers' button, four times in order to remove them all. This was a kink I was not able to fix yet.
